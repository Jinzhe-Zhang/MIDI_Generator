# MIDI_Initializer

Do you like music?

Have you dreamed of making a music by yourself, but tired of the strenuous mouse operation when using midi softwares?

Then you should use this, our MIDI_Generator, which can **!generage readable codes into midi files!**

I'd like to say that this project for me is not about technology but about **dream**. For years, my favorite music is "Cherry Blossom Battlefield Destroyed by Moonlight"（月光摧残下的樱花战场）by Heskey 包子。The melody is so beautiful that we see the notes are dances with our emotion. I used to try to play it when I was a senior student, but that's so complex for me, and I don't want to omit any of the notes in the music. So I have dreamed of make it by myself to experience the beauty of every note (And also, I dreamed of making my own music).
